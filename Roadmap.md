## Final Words

Becoming a globally recognized AI Security expert is a marathon, not a sprint. This roadmap provides the comprehensive path, but your success depends on:

1. **Consistency** - Daily progress, even if small
2. **Depth** - Master fundamentals before rushing to advanced topics
3. **Curiosity** - Always ask "why" and "what if"
4. **Sharing** - Teach what you learn, build in public
5. **Patience** - Recognition takes time
6. **Persistence** - Keep going when it's hard
7. **Passion** - Love what you do

You don't need to follow this roadmap linearly. Identify your current level, start there, and build systematically. Some topics you'll need to master, others you just need to understand.

**The AI Security field is young and rapidly evolving. Your contribution matters. The world needs more AI Security experts.**

**Now, begin your journey. The future is waiting for you to secure it.**
